                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>A mission statement is a short statement of why an organization exists, what its overall goal is,
                    identifying the goal of its operations: what kind of product or service it provides, its primary
                    customers or market, and its geographical region of operation. </p>

                <h2>Vission</h2>
                <p>Dreaming and sleep are intertwined. Dreams occur mainly in the rapid-eye-movement (REM) stage of
                    sleepâ€”when brain activity is high and resembles that of being awake. Because REM sleep is detectable
                    in many species, and because research suggests that all mammals experience REM,[15] linking dreams
                    to REM sleep has led to conjectures that animals dream. </p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>A goal is an idea of the future or desired result that a person or a group of people envision, plan
                    and commit to achieve. People endeavour to reach goals within a finite time by setting deadlines</p>

            <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. Web
                development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web
                applications, electronic businesses, and social network services</p>

            <h3>Global Community</h3>
            <p>The term world community is used primarily in political and humanitarian contexts to describe an
                international aggregate of nation states of widely varying types. In most connotations, the term is used
                to convey meanings attached to consensus or inclusion of all people in all lands and their governments.

                <p>Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to suppress transmission and
                    save lives; the use of a mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection
                    against COVID-19.

                    If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as
                    physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your
                    hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work.</p>
